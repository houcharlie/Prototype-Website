			<p>Mr. Tejaswi S. Patel (Tej) has been an independent wealth advisory professional since 2003. His mandate is to offer specialized investment advice on asset allocation, fixed income investments, creating core equity portfolios, consulting on the selection of outside managers, cash management, alternative investments, and hedging strategies. Prior to his current position, Tej worked for approximately two years advising clients as Vice President in the Private Wealth Management group at Deutsche Bank. He also served as Vice President at First Union Securities (now Wells Fargo), prior to his time at Deutsche Bank. His experiences at these firms helped him develop industry connections, investment perspectives, and familiarity with state-of-the-art resources. However, he chose to abandon the bureaucracy in order to achieve the personalized approach and human impact that he found lacking in these large wire house firms. This way, he could provide his clients with the most promising opportunities and genuinely unbiased advice.</p>
			<p>In his approximately eighteen years of experience, his focus and experience has been in advising high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth families of professionals and entrepreneurs with a goal of optimizing their overall investment returns while minimizing the associated risk. Currently, he maintains a particular expertise in advising established physicians and stands out in his comprehension of the financial considerations commonly encountered by individuals in the medical profession. Tej graduated from Drexel University with a Master of Science in Engineering Management studies. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation and Control) from Gujarat University in India.</p>
			<p>Tej believes in the value of a long-term investment focus, specializing in both defensive and aggressive strategies across the equity, fixed-income, and alternative investment markets. Custom tailoring his portfolios to satisfy the risk appetite of his clientele, he advises them consistently to focus on risk-adjusted returns, while diligently striving to outperform the industry standard benchmarks. He has a disciplined approach towards reducing portfolio volatility, profit locking protection, and exit strategies, which he believes are key to survival in todayâ€™s markets. Much of his expertise has been acquired through hands on experience in the Global Financial Markets since 1996.</p>
